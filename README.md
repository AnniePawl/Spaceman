# Spaceman
A twist on the classic word guessing game. 
The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes. Each dash represents a letter. If the player guesses a letter correctly, that letter replaces the corresponding dash. If a player guesses incorrectly, a piece of the spaceman is drawn. Players get 7 guesses before the spaceman is complete and the game is over.
